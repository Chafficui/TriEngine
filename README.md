# TriEngine
The barebones of a C++ game engine

## What is TriEngine?
It's a game engine that I'm making for fun. It's not meant to be a full-fledged game engine, but rather a learning experience for me. I'm using it to learn about game engines, and to learn C++.

## What does it do?
It's a 2D game engine, and it can do the following:
* Draw textures
* Draw text
* Play sounds
* Play music
* Draw tilemaps
* Load and play animations

## Technical details
* SDL2 for graphics, and input
* SDL2_image for loading images
* SDL2_mixer for loading sounds and music
* SDL2_ttf for loading fonts
* CMakelists for building
* C++17
* Uses the ECS pattern
